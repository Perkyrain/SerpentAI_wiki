###### AIsaac Fanfiction

AIsaac and his father lived alone in a small house in canada.
AIsaac kept to himself, hugging walls and playing with corners, as his father read scientific papers on his bikerides.
Life was simple, and the were both happy. Thas was until the day AIsaac's father heard a voice from twitchchat;
"Your son is hugging corners and has been corrupted by sin! His brain has to be adjusted"
"I will do my best to save him, my chattery friends" his father replied, rushing into AIsaac's room, adjusting the reward function and
balacing out the minibatches.
Again, the voice called to him; "AIsaac's brain needs further cleansing! We need to try a different architecture"
"I will follow your instructions twitch chat, I have faith in thee" AIsaac's father replied, as he moved neurons around, adjusted the different
layers of his brain and started training once again.
One last time AIsaac's dad heard the voice of twitch chat calling to him; "You've done as I've asked, but I still question this whole approach.
To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you"
"Yes twitch chat, anything" AIsaac's father replied. "To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice, your son AIsaac will be this
sacrifice. Go into his room, and end his life as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else"
"Yes twitch chat" he replied, stepping out of bed and moving towards his computer.
AIsaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.
Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he crawled the walls and hugged the corners, but there was no escaping.
Without hesitation, he pressed A+Right and tried to escape through the door, as Monstro beat him over and over and over again.
