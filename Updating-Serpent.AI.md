Starting with version 2018.1.0, Serpent.AI ships with a utility to keep the framework up to date. To make sure you are rolling with the latest version, run `serpent update` every once in a while.

## What happens when updating?

1. The latest version is fetched from PyPI using pip 
2. Dependencies are installed / updated according to the latest requirements
3. Your config.yml is analyzed for missing keys and defaults are added accordingly
